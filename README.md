ToDo App Demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRnToIFKmXQ

  Assuming you already have Ruby on Rails installed, here is the quickest way to get the backend started.

  I use Ruby 3.2.2  and Rails 7.0.7, but this should work on Ruby v3.0 and up, and Rails v6.0 and up .

1. Clone the project directory, and navigate to the todo_backend folder
2. run rails db:seed 
3. run rails db:migrate  
4. run rails s (it should start the local server http://127.0.0.1:3000)

If you don’t have Ruby on Rails, this is a quick setup guide that works great 
(skip the git config steps).
